# Architecture of NaariKavach Project

## Overview
The NaariKavach project is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for women's safety through a combination of a frontend React.js application, a backend Node.js + Express API, and a Python-based NLP chatbot service. The architecture is modular, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Components

### Frontend
- **Technology**: React.js
- **Structure**:
  - **public/**: Contains static files, including the main HTML file.
  - **src/**: Contains the main application logic, including components, pages, services, hooks, context, utils, assets, styles, and tests.
- **Key Features**:
  - User-friendly interface for interaction.
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop views.
  - Integration with backend APIs for real-time data.

### Backend
- **Technology**: Node.js + Express
- **Structure**:
  - **src/**: Contains the main application file, routes, controllers, models, middleware, utils, config, workers, logs, and tests.
- **Key Features**:
  - RESTful API for handling requests from the frontend.
  - Middleware for authentication and validation.
  - Database integration for user and SOS management.

### NLP Service
- **Technology**: Python
- **Structure**:
  - **chatbot/**: Contains the core logic for the chatbot, including intent classification and response generation.
  - **models/**: Stores trained machine learning models for intent classification and unsafe zone detection.
- **Key Features**:
  - Multilingual support for diverse user interactions.
  - NLP capabilities for understanding user intents and generating appropriate responses.

### Deployment Infrastructure
- **Technology**: Docker and Kubernetes
- **Structure**:
  - **docker/**: Contains Dockerfiles for building images for the frontend, backend, and AI service.
